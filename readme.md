Forked from https://github.com/sindresorhus/pure, and tweaked slightly.

## Changes
- Some default colors are different:
	- Normal prompt is cyan
	- Git arrows are yellow
	- Command time is magenta
	- Root username is red
	- git branch "modified" star is yellow
	- Etc.
- git up/down arrows now show the commit counts
- The exit code of a failed command is now displayed
